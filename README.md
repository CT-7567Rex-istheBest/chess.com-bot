# chess.com-bot
Insanely Fast chess.com bot, uses stockfish 14 with a chromedriver, calculates perfect moves in under a second compared to other slow bots. Instantly moves for you in lightspeed. All of the credit done on this project goes to my friend Luna__. Refactored and made it work better



# How to use
Create a folder called "bin" and drag the stockfish 14 executable into it, create a chess.com account and get the cookie called "PHPSSEID" and import that into the config.js
Bot may error sometimes on first move && on the first login on the account (due to prompts), but 99% works
